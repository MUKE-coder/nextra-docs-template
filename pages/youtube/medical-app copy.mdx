# Medical App Setup Guide

Thank you for purchasing our Medical App source code! This guide will walk you through the process of setting up and running the application on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later) installed on your computer
- npm (usually comes with Node.js)
- A code editor of your choice (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text)

## Step 1: Unzip the Source Code

1. Locate the zipped file containing the source code that you received after your purchase.
2. Unzip the file to a directory of your choice on your computer.

## Step 2: Install Dependencies

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where you unzipped the source code:
   ```
   cd path/to/medical-app
   ```
3. Run the following command to install all required dependencies:
   ```bash copy
   npm install
   ```

## Step 3: Set Up Environment Variables

1. In the terminal, run the setup wizard:
   ```bash copy
   npm run setup
   ```
2. This will open abrowser window, Follow the prompts in the wizard to input all required environment variables.
3. This process will create a `.env` file in your project root with the necessary configuration.

## Step 4: Restart the Server

If you had the development server running, restart it to apply the new environment variables:

1. Stop the current server process (usually by pressing Ctrl+C in the terminal).
2. Start the server again with:
   ```bash copy
    npm run dev
   ```

## Step 5: Seed the Database

To populate your database with initial data, run the seed script:

```bash copy
npm run seed
```

This will create dummy data, including user accounts for testing.

## Step 6: Access the Application

1. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified in your environment setup).
2. You should now see the login page of your Medical App.

## Default User Accounts

The seeding process creates three default user accounts for testing:

1. **Admin**

   - Email: admin@admin.com
   - Password: admin

2. **Doctor**

   - Email: doctor@doctor.com
   - Password: doctor

3. **Patient**
   - Email: patient@patient.com
   - Password: patient

You can use these credentials to log in and explore different user roles within the application.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during the setup process:

1. Ensure all dependencies are correctly installed (Step 2).
2. Double-check that all environment variables are properly set (Step 3).
3. Make sure your database is running and accessible.
4. Check the console output for any error messages.

If problems persist, please refer to our documentation or contact our support team.

Happy coding, and enjoy your new Medical App!
