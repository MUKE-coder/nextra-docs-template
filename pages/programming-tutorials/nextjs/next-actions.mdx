# How to use react-hook-form with Next.js Server Actions and Zod Input validation

![Hello](/server-actions.png)

If you've worked with more forms within Next.js (or React in general), chances are you've used react-hook-form, a "performant, flexible and extensible forms with easy-to-use validation" (as per their website).

I've used react-hook-form for a long time now and with the recent announcement of Server Actions becoming stable in Next.js 14 I've gotten curious about how to use these tools together.

### Prerequisites

For this guide, we assume you've got a Next.js 14 installation. Additionally, we need react-hook-form and, as a bonus, we're gonna use Zod for advanced input validation:

### Install Dependencies

```bash copy
npm install react-hook-form zod @hookform/resolvers
```

It's important to note that server actions are still pretty new and some libraries, like react-hook-form, will certainly improve support of them in the future. For this guide, I'm using react-hook-form v7.48.
