  //Fetch all the products, then find a single product
  const products = await getProducts();
  const product = products.find((product) => product.slug == slug);
  return {
    title: product?.title,
    description: product?.seoDescription,
    alternates: {
      canonical: `/products/${product?.slug}`,
    },
    openGraph: {
      title: product.title,
      description: product.description,
      images: [product.thumbnail],
    },
  };
}
```

- They can help search engines to prioritize crawling and indexing your most important pages. This can help your most important pages to rank higher in search results pages.

```ts copy
//app/sitemap.ts
export default function sitemap() {
  return [
    {
      url: "https://acme.com",
      lastModified: new Date(),
      changeFrequency: "yearly",
      priority: 1,
    },
    {
      url: "https://acme.com/about",
      lastModified: new Date(),
      changeFrequency: "monthly",
      priority: 0.8,
    },
    {
      url: "https://acme.com/blog",
      lastModified: new Date(),
      changeFrequency: "weekly",
      priority: 0.5,
    },
  ];
}
```

### Generate Dynamic Sitemap

If your fetching data in your application, then you need to generate your sitemap dynamically. so modify your sitemap.js

```ts copy
//app/sitemap.js
import getCategories from "./libs/getCategories";
import getProducts from "./libs/getProducts";

export default async function sitemap() {
  const baseUrl = "https://lighthousefurniture.com";

  const products = await getProducts();
  const categories = await getCategories();
  const productUrls = products.map((product) => {
    return {
      url: `${baseUrl}/products/${product.slug}`,
      lastModified: new Date(),
    };
  });
  const categoryUrls = categories.map((category) => {
    return {
      url: `${baseUrl}/categories/${category.slug}`,
      lastModified: new Date(),
    };
  });

  return [
    {
      url: baseUrl,
      lastModified: new Date(),
    },
    {
      url: `${baseUrl}/about`,
      lastModified: new Date(),
    },
    {
      url: `${baseUrl}/contact`,
      lastModified: new Date(),
    },
    ...productUrls,
    ...categoryUrls,
  ];
}
```

## Generate Static Robots.txt

A robots.txt file is a text file that tells search engine crawlers which pages on your website they are allowed to crawl and index. Robots.txt files are important for SEO because they can help you to control how your website is indexed and ranked by search engines.

Here are some of the benefits of using a robots.txt file:

- You can prevent search engines from crawling and indexing pages that are not ready for public viewing.This can be useful for pages that are still under construction or that contain sensitive information.
- A robots.txt file can be used to give search engines the exact location of your sitemap. This can help search engines to find your sitemap more easily and to crawl and index your website more efficiently.

```tsx copy
export default function robots() {
  const baseUrl = "https://lighthousefurniture.com";
  return {
    rules: {
      userAgent: "*",
      allow: ["/", "/product", "/category"],
      disallow: [],
    },
    sitemap: `${baseUrl}/sitemap.xml`,
  };
}
```
