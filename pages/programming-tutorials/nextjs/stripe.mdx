Most developers will agree that integrating payments into a Next.js application is a complex task that often results in frustrating bugs and setbacks.

## Stripe Checkout for Next.js Applications

Stripe Checkout is a pre-built payment page that allows you to securely collect customer payment information in your Next.js application. It offers a seamless integration with Stripe's payment processing infrastructure to handle payments with just a few lines of code.

Checkout is useful for Next.js developers as it:

- Speeds up implementation of payments by handling complex logic behind the scenes
- Provides automatic localization and optimization for mobile
- Allows custom styling to match your brand identity
- Includes built-in security and compliance

To add Checkout to a Next.js app, you'll need to:

### Set up a Stripe account

First, [sign up for a Stripe account](https://stripe.com/signup). Stripe offers test data and API keys to build out your integration during development.

#### Install the Stripe SDK

```bash copy
 npm install @stripe/stripe-js
```

This installs the official Stripe JS SDK.
