### **What is JavaScript?**
JavaScript is a programming language that is commonly used to add interactive features to websites. It is a client-side language, which means that it is executed by the user's web browser rather than on a server. This allows for the creation of dynamic and responsive web pages that can interact with users in real-time.
### **Key Features of JavaScript**
**Interactivity:** JavaScript allows you to create interactive web pages.

**Client-Side Validation:** Reduces server load by validating user input before sending it to the server.

**Dynamic Content:** Modify content on the webpage without reloading the entire page.

**Event Handling:** Respond to user actions like clicks, mouse movements, and keypresses.

**Cross-Platform:** Runs on any device with a web browser.

### **Basic Structure of a JavaScript Program**
A JavaScript program is made up of one or more scripts. A script is a sequence of statements that tell the computer what to do. Here are some of the scripts commonly used in JavaScript;

**1. console.log() and alert():** console.log is used to display output in the browser's console whereas alert is a built-in function that displays a pop-up box with a specified message
```js copy
console.log('Hello world!')
//This code will display the text "Hello, world!" in the browser's console

alert('Hello world!')
//This code will display a pop-up box with the text "Hello, world!"
```

**2. Variables:** In JavaScript, a variable is a named container that holds a value. You can declare a variable using the var, let, or const keyword, followed by the variable name. For example:
```js copy
// Using let (used when a variable is expected to change)  where; age is the variable name
let age = 25;

// Using const (constant value) where; country is the variable name
const country = 'USA';
```
**3. Data Types:** JavaScript supports various data types:
     
     **String:**  A sequence of characters, represented by enclosing the characters in quotes (single or double). Examples: "Hello", 'World', '20'.

     **Number:**  A numerical value. Examples: 123, 3.14.

     **Boolean:** A value that can be either true or false. Used for taking Decisions.

     **Undefined:**  : A value that is assigned to a variable that has not been given a value yet.

     **Null:**  A special value that represents an absence of value.

     **Array:** Arrays store multiple values in a single variable.

     **Object:** Objects store data in key-value pairs.
     ```js copy
     //String
     let name = 'Alice';  

  //Number    
let age = 30; 

//Boolean
let isStudent = true;  

//Array
let hobbies = ['reading', 'traveling', 'coding'];

//Object
let person = {          
  firstName: 'John',
  lastName: 'Doe',
  age: 40
};
````

**4. Operetors:**  operators allow you to manipulate data, make comparisons, and control the flow of your code. Here is a more detailed look at the various types of operators in JavaScript.

**a. Arithmetic Operators:** Arithmetic operators are used to perform basic mathematical operations.

**Addition (+):** used in addition instances.
```js copy
const sum = 2 + 3;
console.log(sum)
//It will display 5 in the browser's console.
```

**Subtraction (-):** Subtracts one number from another.
```js copy
const difference = 5 - 3; 
console.log(difference)
//It will display 2 in the browser's console.
```

**Multiplication (*):** Multiplies two numbers.
```js copy
const product = 2 * 3; 
console.log(product)
//It will display 6 in the browser's console.
```

**Division (/):** Divides one number by another.
```js copy
let quotient = 6 / 3; 
 console.log(quotient)
//It will display 2 in the browser's console.
```

**Modulus (%):** Returns the remainder of a division.
```js copy
let remainder = 7 % 3;
 console.log(remainder)
//It will display 1 in the browser's console.
```

**Increment (++):** Increases a number by one.
```js copy
let x = 5;
x++;
 console.log(X)
//It will display 6 in the browser's console.
```

**Decrement (--):** Decreases a number by one.
```js copy
let Y = 5;
Y--; 
 console.log(Y)
//It will display 4 in the browser's console.
```

**b. Assignment Operators:** Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.

**Assignment (=):** Assigns a value to a variable.
```js copy
let x = 10;
 console.log(X)
```
**c.  Comparison Operators:** Comparison operators compare two values and return a boolean result ('true' or 'false').

**Equal (==):** Compares two values for equality (type conversion is performed).
```js copy
let result = (5 == '5'); // true
 console.log(result)
 //It will display true in the browser's console.
 ```

**Strict Equal (===): **  Compares two values for equality without type conversion.
```js copy
let result = (5 === '5'); // true
 console.log(result)
 //It will display false in the browser's console.
 ```

**Not Equal (!=):**  Compares two values for inequality (type conversion is performed).
```js copy
const result = (5 != '5'); 
 console.log(result)
 //It will display false in the browser's console.
 ```

**Strict Not Equal (!==):**  Compares two values for inequality without type conversion.
```js copy
let result = (5 !== '5'); 
 console.log(result)
 //It will display true in the browser's console.
 ```

**Greater Than (>):** Checks if the left value is greater than the right value.
```js copy
const result = (10 > 5);
 console.log(result)
 //It will display true in the browser's console.
 ```

**Less Than:** Checks if the left value is less than the right value.
```js copy
let result = (10 < 5); 
 console.log(result)
 //It will display false in the browser's console.
 ```

**Greater Than or Equal (>=):** Checks if the left value is greater than or equal to the right value.
```js copy
let result = (10 >= 10); 
 console.log(result)
 //It will display true in the browser's console.
 ```

**Less Than or Equal (`<=`):** Checks if the left value is less than or equal to the right value.
```js copy
let result = (10 <= 10); 
 console.log(result)
 //It will display true in the browser's console.
 ```
 **c. Logical Operators:** Logical operators are used to combine multiple boolean expressions.

 **AND (&&):** Returns true if both operands are true.
```js copy
const result = (5 > 3 && 10 > 5); // true
 console.log(result)
 //It will display true in the browser's console.
 ```

 **OR (||):** Returns true if at least one of the operands is true.
```js copy
const result = (5 > 3 || 10 < 5); // true
 console.log(result)
 //It will display true in the browser's console.
 ```

 **NOT (!):** Returns true if the operand is false.
```js copy
let result = !(5 > 3);
 console.log(result)
 //It will display false in the browser's console.
 ```
 **d. Conditional operator (? :):** The conditional operator, also known as the ternary operator, is a shorthand way of writing an if statement. It is used with the ? and : symbols. For example:
 ```js copy
 let x = 10;
let y = 20;
let max = (x > y) ? x : y; // max is 20
 ```
 This code is equivalent to the following if statement:
```js copy
let max;
if (x > y) {
    max = x;
} else {
    max = y;
}
```


**5. Control Structures:** Control structures are used to control the flow of a program, based on certain conditions.

 **Conditional Statements:** Control the flow of your code using conditional statements.
 ```js copy
 let time = 20;

if (time < 12) {
  console.log('Good morning!');
} else if (time < 18) {
  console.log('Good afternoon!');
} else {
  console.log('Good evening!');
}
 ```


**6. Functions:** 

Functions are reusable blocks of code.

```js copy
// Function declaration
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

// Calling a function
let greeting = greet('Alice');
console.log(greeting); 
//It will display Hello, Alice! in the browser's console.
 ```
