### **What is JavaScript?**

JavaScript is a programming language that is commonly used to add interactive features to websites. It is a client-side language, which means that it is executed by the user's web browser rather than on a server. This allows for the creation of dynamic and responsive web pages that can interact with users in real-time.

### **Key Features of JavaScript**

**Interactivity:** JavaScript allows you to create interactive web pages.

**Client-Side Validation:** Reduces server load by validating user input before sending it to the server.

**Dynamic Content:** Modify content on the webpage without reloading the entire page.

**Event Handling:** Respond to user actions like clicks, mouse movements, and keypresses.

**Cross-Platform:** Runs on any device with a web browser.

### Getting Started with JavaScript.

**Where to write JavaScript**

![JavaScript](/JavasciptIntro.png)

You can write JavaScript directly in an HTML file within `<script>` tags.

```js copy
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>My Website</title>
</head>
<body>
  <script>
    // Your JavaScript code here
  </script>
</body>
</html>

```

You can also create a separate `.js` file and link it to your HTML file.

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="website" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.File name="index.html" />
    <FileTree.File name="style.css" />
    <FileTree.File name="app.js" />
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

```js copy
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>My Website</title>
</head>
<body>
//linking js file to HTML file
  <script src='app.js'></script>
</body>
</html>

```
