### **What is JavaScript?**
JavaScript is a programming language used to create interactive web pages. It makes websites dynamic, allowing features like animations, user input responses, and complex applications.
### **Key Features of JavaScript**
**Interactivity:** JavaScript allows you to create interactive web pages.

**Client-Side Validation:** Reduces server load by validating user input before sending it to the server.

**Dynamic Content:** Modify content on the webpage without reloading the entire page.

**Event Handling:** Respond to user actions like clicks, mouse movements, and keypresses.

**Cross-Platform:** Runs on any device with a web browser.

### **Basic Structure of a JavaScript Program**
A JavaScript program is made up of one or more scripts. A script is a sequence of statements that tell the computer what to do. Here are some of the scripts commonly used in JavaScript;

**1. console.log() and alert():** console.log is used to display output in the browser's console whereas alert is a built-in function that displays a pop-up box with a specified message
```js copy
console.log('Hello world!')
//This code will display the text "Hello, world!" in the browser's console

alert('Hello world!')
//This code will display a pop-up box with the text "Hello, world!"
```

**2. Variables:** Variables are containers for storing data values.
```js copy
// Using let (used when a variable is expected to change)  where; age is the variable name
let age = 25;

// Using const (constant value) where; country is the variable name
const country = 'USA';
```
**3. Data Types:** JavaScript supports various data types:
     
     **String:**  Represents text(Textual data) denoted by ( "" or '' ) eg ( "Hello", 'world', '20' ).

     **Number:**  Represents numeric values eg (1,2,3,4).

     **Boolean:** Represent true or false values (e.g., true, false).

     **Undefined:**  Represents a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.

     **Null:**  Represents the intentional absence of any object value.

     **Array:** Arrays store multiple values in a single variable.

     **Object:** Objects store data in key-value pairs.
     ```js copy
     //String
     let name = 'Alice';  

  //Number    
let age = 30; 

//Boolean
let isStudent = true;  

//Array
let hobbies = ['reading', 'traveling', 'coding'];

//Object
let person = {          
  firstName: 'John',
  lastName: 'Doe',
  age: 40
};
````

**4. Operetors:**  operators allow you to manipulate data, make comparisons, and control the flow of your code. Here is a more detailed look at the various types of operators in JavaScript.

**a. Arithmetic Operators:** Arithmetic operators are used to perform basic mathematical operations.

**Addition (+):** used in addition instances.
```js copy
const sum = 2 + 3;
console.log(sum)
//It will display 5 in the browser's console.
```

**Subtraction (-):** Subtracts one number from another.
```js copy
const difference = 5 - 3; 
console.log(difference)
//It will display 2 in the browser's console.
```

**Multiplication (*):** Multiplies two numbers.
```js copy
const product = 2 * 3; 
console.log(product)
//It will display 6 in the browser's console.
```

**Division (/):** Divides one number by another.
```js copy
let quotient = 6 / 3; 
 console.log(quotient)
//It will display 2 in the browser's console.
```

**Modulus (%):** Returns the remainder of a division.
```js copy
let remainder = 7 % 3;
 console.log(remainder)
//It will display 1 in the browser's console.
```

**Increment (++):** Increases a number by one.
```js copy
let x = 5;
x++;
 console.log(X)
//It will display 6 in the browser's console.
```

**Decrement (--):** Decreases a number by one.
```js copy
let Y = 5;
Y--; 
 console.log(Y)
//It will display 4 in the browser's console.
```
