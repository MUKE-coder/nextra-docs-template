#### JavaScript Data types

In JavaScript, there are two main types of data: primitive data types and objects data types.

**primitive:** Primitive data types are simple data types that represent a single value. The primitive data types in JavaScript are: String, Number, Boolean, Null, Undefined.

  JavaScript has dynamic typing: We do not have to manually define the data type
  of the value stored in a variable. Instead, data types are determined
  automatically.
</Callout>

To check the data type of a value in JavaScript, you can use the **typeof** operator. The **typeof** operator returns a string that represents the type of the value.

```js copy
console.log(typeof "world");
//It will display String in the browser's console.
console.log(typeof 144);
//It will display Number in the browser's console.
console.log(typeof true);
//It will display Boolean in the browser's console.
```

In JavaScript, strings are immutable, which means that you cannot modify individual characters of a string.

```js copy
let name = "John";
name = "Jane"; // allowed
name[0] = "J"; // not allowed
```

In this example, the **name** variable is assigned the value **John**, which is a string. The value of the **name** variable can be changed by assigning a new value to it (e.g. name = "Jane"). However, you cannot change the individual characters of the string directly.

**Objects:** Objects are complex data types that can contain multiple values and properties. Objects are used to represent real-world entities or abstract concepts with multiple characteristics. Objects are created using the **{}** syntax and can contain multiple properties, which are represented as key-value pairs. For example:

```js copy
let person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  age: 30,
  isEmployed: true,
};
```

In this example, the **person** object has four properties: firstName, lastName, age, and isEmployed. Each property has a key (the property name) and a value (the property value).

  You can access the properties of an object using the . notation or the []
  notation:
</Callout>
```js copy console.log(person.firstName); //It will display John in the browser's
console. console.log(person["lastName"]); //It will display Doe in the browser's
console. ```
<Callout emoji="ðŸ’¡">
  Objects are mutable, which means that you can change their properties and
  values at any time.
</Callout>
