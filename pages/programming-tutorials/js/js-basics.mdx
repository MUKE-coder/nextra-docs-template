### Getting Started with JavaScript.
**Where to write JavaScript**

You can write JavaScript directly in an HTML file within `<script>` tags.
```js copy
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>My Website</title>
</head>
<body>
  <script>
    // Your JavaScript code here
  </script>
</body>
</html>

```
You can also create a separate `.js` file and link it to your HTML file.

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="website" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.File name="index.html" />
    <FileTree.File name="style.css" />
    <FileTree.File name="app.js" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

```js copy
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>My Website</title>
</head>
<body>
//linking js file to HTML file
  <script src='app.js'></script>
</body>
</html>

```

#### JavaScript Data types
In JavaScript, there are two main types of data: primitive data types and objects data types.

**primitive:** Primitive data types are simple data types that represent a single value. The primitive data types in JavaScript are: String, Number, Boolean, Null, Undefined.

  JavaScript has dynamic typing: We do not have to manually define the data type of  the value stored in a variable. Instead, data types are determined automatically.
</Callout>

To check the data type of a value in JavaScript, you can use the **typeof** operator. The **typeof** operator returns a string that represents the type of the value.
```js copy
console.log(typeof "world")
//It will display String in the browser's console.
console.log(typeof 144)
//It will display Number in the browser's console.
console.log(typeof true)
//It will display Boolean in the browser's console.
```
In JavaScript, strings are immutable, which means that you cannot modify individual characters of a string.
```js copy
let name = "John";
name = "Jane"; // allowed
name[0] = "J"; // not allowed
```
In this example, the **name** variable is assigned the value **John**, which is a string. The value of the **name** variable can be changed by assigning a new value to it (e.g. name = "Jane"). However, you cannot change the individual characters of the string directly.

**Objects:** Objects are complex data types that can contain multiple values and properties. Objects are used to represent real-world entities or abstract concepts with multiple characteristics. Objects are created using the **{}** syntax and can contain multiple properties, which are represented as key-value pairs. For example:
```js copy
let person = {
    firstName: "John",
    lastName: "Doe",
    age: 30,
    isEmployed: true
};
```
In this example, the **person** object has four properties: firstName, lastName, age, and isEmployed. Each property has a key (the property name) and a value (the property value).


<Callout emoji="ðŸ’¡">
 You can access the properties of an object using the . notation or the [] notation:
</Callout>
```js copy
console.log(person.firstName);
//It will display John in the browser's console.
console.log(person["lastName"]); 
//It will display Doe in the browser's console.
```
<Callout emoji="ðŸ’¡">
 Objects are mutable, which means that you can change their properties and values at any time.
</Callout>

### Javascript Control Structures
**if statement:** The if statement is used to execute a block of code if a condition is true. For example:
```js copy
let x = 10;
if (x > 0) {
    console.log("x is positive");

//This code will output "x is positive" to the console, because the condition x > 0 is true.
}
```

**If-else statement:** You can also use an else clause to specify a block of code that should be executed if the condition is false:
```js copy
let x = 10;
if (x > 0) {
    console.log("x is positive");
    
//This code will output "x is positive" to the console, because the condition x > 0 is true.
}else {
    console.log("x is not positive");

//This code will output "x is not positive" to the console, if  the condition x > 0 is false.
}
```
**Switch statement:** The switch statement is used to execute a block of code based on the value of a variable. For example:
```js copy
let x = "red";
switch (x) {
    case "red":
        console.log("x is red");
        break;
    case "blue":
        console.log("x is blue");
        break;
    default:
        console.log("x is neither red nor blue");
}
```
This code will output "x is red" to the console, because the value of x is "red". The switch statement is often used as an alternative to a series of if statements, when you have to check multiple values.
