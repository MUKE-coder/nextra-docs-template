# Introduction to HTML and CSS

Welcome to the exciting world of web development! HTML (HyperText Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are the foundational technologies used to create and style websites. HTML provides the structure of the page, while CSS is used to control the visual presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts. Together, they enable you to build visually appealing and interactive websites.

**HTML (HyperText Markup Language)**: Imagine HTML as the skeleton of a website. It defines the structure and content of a webpage, using tags to tell the browser what to display and how to organize it. Think of headings, paragraphs, images, and links – these are all created with HTML tags.

  HTML tags are the building blocks of web pages. Each HTML tag consists of a
  keyword enclosed in angle brackets, and they often come in pairs: an opening
  tag and a closing tag eg `<p></p>`.

**CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)**: Once the webpage structure is set with HTML, CSS is like the designer's toolbox. It allows you to add style and visual flair to your webpage. You can control fonts, colors, layouts, backgrounds, and more, making your website come alive!
