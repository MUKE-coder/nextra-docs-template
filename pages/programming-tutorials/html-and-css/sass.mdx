#### Introduction

Sass (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) is a pre-processor language that extends the capabilities of CSS. It provides a more dynamic and efficient way to write CSS, making it easier to manage large stylesheets by offering features such as variables, nested rules, mixins, and functions.

**Sass compiler:** In order to use sass efficiently an extension was Introduced to avoid the installation of sass using the commandline and it is called **live sass compiler by Glenn Marks.**

### installation of sass live compiler

<Steps>
### Open VS Code
 
Launch Visual Studio Code.
 
### Access Extensions
 
 Go to the Extensions tab in the sidebar (usually on the left) or use the shortcut (Ctrl+Shift+X).  In the search bar, type "Live Sass Compiler and locate the extension by Glenn Marks and click the "Install" button.
</Steps>

#### Enabling Live Compilation

**Open an SCSS File:** Create or open an SCSS file (.scss extension) in your project.

**Activate Live Sass:**
On the status Bar, Look for a button in the status bar at the bottom that might say "Click to Watch Sass" or a similar indication. Click it to enable live compilation.


#### **Why we use Sass?**

**Improved Maintainability:** Sass makes your stylesheets more organized and readable. Variables and mixins allow you to manage styles centrally, making updates easier and reducing the risk of errors.

**Enhanced Features:** Sass offers functionalities not available in vanilla CSS, including operations, functions for color manipulation, and control flow statements.

### **Key Features of Sass**

##### An HTML example to use 

```HTML5 copy filename="index.html"
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge">
  <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
<nav>
<ul>
<li>
<a href='#'>Hello world</a>
<li>
</ul>
</nav>
</body>
</html>
```

**Variables:** Variables in Sass make it easy to manage and reuse values eg colors, fonts etc throughout your stylesheet.
```SCSS copy
//variables//
$font-stack: Helvetica, sans-serif;
$primary-color: #333;
 
 //usage of variables//
body {
  font-family: $font-stack;
  color: $primary-color;
}
```

**Nesting:** Nesting in Sass allows you to write your CSS in a nested hierarchy that follows the same visual structure of your HTML. This makes it easier to read and maintain.
```SCSS copy
//all other tags are placed inside a the nav tag
nav {
  ul {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    list-style: none;
  }

  li { display: inline-block; }

  a {
    display: block;
    padding: 6px 12px;
    text-decoration: none;
  }
}
```

**Partials:** Partials are Sass files that contain little code snippets of CSS that can be included in other Sass files. They are named with a leading underscore '(_)'. This helps in keeping your styles organized and maintainable, especially in large projects.  All these files can be inside one folder which is mostly named as **partials.** In that folder there are two files to always start and they include; 

the one which includes all the variables for example variables for fonts, colors and many more and it usually name **_variables.scss.**

the one which includes all the changes that afffect the whole websites eg fonts, colors and many more and it usually name **_globels.scss.**

 The order is as follows.

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="partials" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.File name="_globels.scss" />
    <FileTree.File name="_variables.scss" />
      </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

**Importing Partials:** To use a partials in your main Sass file **(style.scss)**, use the **@import** directive. When you import a partial, you do not include the underscore or the file extension as shown below;

```scss copy filename="style.scss"
@import './partials/variables';
@import './partials/globels';
```
 <Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Take caution that the variables files must always be the first when importing.
</Callout>
