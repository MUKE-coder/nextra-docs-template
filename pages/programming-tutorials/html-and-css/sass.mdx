#### Introduction

Sass (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) is a pre-processor language that extends the capabilities of CSS. It provides a more dynamic and efficient way to write CSS, making it easier to manage large stylesheets by offering features such as variables, nested rules, mixins, and functions.

**Sass compiler:** In order to use sass efficiently an extension was Introduced to avoid the installation of sass using the commandline and it is called **live sass compiler by Glenn Marks.**

#### **Why we use Sass?**

**Improved Maintainability:** Sass makes your stylesheets more organized and readable. Variables and mixins allow you to manage styles centrally, making updates easier and reducing the risk of errors.

**Enhanced Features:** Sass offers functionalities not available in vanilla CSS, including operations, functions for color manipulation, and control flow statements.

### Key Features of Sass

**Variables:** Variables in Sass make it easy to manage and reuse values eg colors, fonts etc throughout your stylesheet.
```SCSS copy
//variables//
$font-stack: Helvetica, sans-serif;
$primary-color: #333;
 
 //usage of variables//
body {
  font-family: $font-stack;
  color: $primary-color;
}
```

**Nesting:** Nesting in Sass allows you to write your CSS in a nested hierarchy that follows the same visual structure of your HTML. This makes it easier to read and maintain.
```SCSS copy
nav {
//all other tags are placed inside a 
  ul {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    list-style: none;
  }

  li { display: inline-block; }

  a {
    display: block;
    padding: 6px 12px;
    text-decoration: none;
  }
}
```
