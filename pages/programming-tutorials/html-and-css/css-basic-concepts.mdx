### CSS Comments

CSS comments are used to annotate your CSS code, making it easier to understand and maintain. Comments can provide explanations or notes about the CSS code, which is especially useful when working on large projects or collaborating with other developers. Comments are ignored by the browser, so they do not affect the rendered page

**Usage:**
CSS comments are enclosed within /\* \*/. Anything between these symbols will be treated as a comment and not processed by the browser

    ```bash copy

/_ This is a single-line comment _/
p {
color: blue; /_ This is an inline comment _/
}

/_
This is a
multi-line comment
_/
body {
background-color: lightgrey;
}
