# Deployment and Hosting

### Deployment

Refers to the process of transferring a web application from a local development environment to a live server where it can be accessed by users. 

##### Steps under taken during deployment

<Steps>
### Build Process
 
Converting source code into a format that can be efficiently run on a server. This might include compiling, bundling, and minifying code.
 
### Configuration
 
Setting environment variables, configuring servers, and setting up databases.

### Testing
 
Ensuring that the application works as expected in the live environment. This may involve running automated tests or manual testing.

### Transfer
 
Uploading the application files to the server. This can be done via FTP, SSH, or through deployment tools and services.

### Monitoring and Maintenance
 
Continuously monitoring the application for issues and making updates as needed.
</Steps>

### Hosting

This is the service that provides the space (storage) for your website's files and the computing power to run it, or provides the infrastructure necessary to run a website or the web application which include;

**Web Server:** A server that delivers web pages to users' browsers upon request. Popular web servers include Apache, Nginx, and Microsoft's Internet Information Services (IIS).

**Domain Name:** A human-readable address (like example.com) that users can type into their browsers to access the website. Domain names are registered through domain registrars.

**Storage:** Space on a server to store the website's files, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, and other assets.

**Bandwidth:** The amount of data that can be transferred from the server to users over a period. Higher bandwidth allows more users to access the site simultaneously.

**Security:** Measures to protect the website from threats such as DDoS **(Distributed Denial-of-Service)** attacks, hacking attempts, and malware. This includes SSL certificates for HTTPS, firewalls, and regular security updates.

#### Types of Hosting

**Shared Hosting:** Multiple websites share the same server and resources. This is cost-effective but can be slower and less secure.

**VPS Hosting:** A Virtual Private Server (VPS) provides more control and resources than shared hosting, with each website running on its own virtual environment.

**Dedicated Hosting:** An entire server is dedicated to one website. This offers maximum performance and control but is more expensive.

**Cloud Hosting**: Websites are hosted on a network of servers in the cloud, offering scalability and reliability. Examples include Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Microsoft Azure.

**Managed Hosting:** The hosting provider takes care of server management tasks, including updates, security, and backups.

### Deployment and Hosting Services.

#### Vercel 
 A service for hosting websites and web applications with continuous deployment from Git repositories.
 ##### Deployment and Hosting using Vercel

 <Steps>
###  Prepare Your Application
 
Ensuring your code is clean and free of errors,
setting environment variables for production, 
building your application (if necessary).

### Create a Vercel Account
 
Sign up for a free or paid Vercel account using your gitHub credentials in oreder link your Git provider account to Vercel.
 
### Import your Project

Select the Git repository containing your website code and import it into Vercel.

### Framework (Optional)
 
Vercel often automatically detects the framework your project uses (e.g., Next.js, Gatsby). You can confirm or adjust this setting if needed.

### Set Environment Variables
 
If your application requires environment variables

**Go to Project Settings:** Navigate to your project settings on Vercel.

**Environment Variables:** Add the required environment variables under the "Environment Variables" section.

### Deploy Your Project
 
Press the deploy button and Vercel will build and deploy your website. You'll be provided with a live URL for your website.  If connected to a Git repository, Vercel will automatically deploy your project every time you push changes to the connected branch.
