# **WHAT IS HTML?**

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a markup language that web developers use to structure and describe the content of a webpage (not a programming language). For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables. Web browsers understand HTML and render HTML code as websites.

## **HTML Document Layout**

```HTML

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>

```

### Layout Exaplanations

`<!DOCTYPE html>` : Is used to define the document type and version of HTML being used in a webpage and ensures that the web browser renders the page correctly according to the HTML5 specifications.

`<html></html>` : is the root element of an HTML document. It encompasses all the content of the webpage.

`<title></title>` : Specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab).

`<head></head>` : contains meta information about the HTML page. Meta information describes the page's content, character encoding, author, keywords, viewport settings, and other details. Metadata is not displayed on the page itself but is used by browsers, search engines, and other web services to understand and process the content of the page.

`<body></body>` : Acts as a container for all the visible contents, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.

### Starting up a project with HTML in Vs code

<Steps>
####  Download and Install VS Code
 
If you haven't already, download and install VS Code from the official website(link and procedures in the html and css tutorials introduction).

####  Set Up Your Project Folder
 
On your computer, create a new folder where you'll store your website files. Open the folder in Vs code.

####  Create your first HTML file
 
In VS Code, go to the "File" menu again and select "New File" (or press Ctrl+N).
Name your new file **index.html** ( this is a common naming convention for the main page of a website).

 
#### Add Basic HTML Structure
 
Open the **index.html** file.
Type **!** and press **Tab** or **Enter**. This is a shortcut provided by Emmet, a plugin included in VS Code that helps you write HTML and CSS faster. It will generate a basic HTML structure for you, and it should look like this;
```HTML5 copy
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge">
  <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
  
</body>
</html>

```
</Steps>

## HTML Elements

HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML documents and consist of an opening tag, content, and a closing tag.

```HTML5 copy
<h1>This is a the biggest heading...</h1>
<h6>This is a the smallest heading...</h6>

```HTML5 copy
<h1>This is a the <span>heading</span>...</h1>
```
