## **WHAT IS HTML?**

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a markup language that web developers use to structure and describe the content of a webpage (not a programming language).

For example, Think of webpage as a newspaper. Newspaper consists of different contents like headings , paragraphs, images, etc. In this scenario HTML is like the layout and structure of the newspaper — it determines where the headings go, how paragraphs are arranged, where images are placed, and how everything is organized on the page.

Just like a newspaper's layout provides order and readability, HTML provides the framework that makes a webpage's content understandable and accessible to both users and web browsers.

For example, take the following line of content:

```txt copy
My dog is very playful
```

If we wanted the line to stand by itself on the webpage, we could specify that it is a paragraph by enclosing it in paragraph tags:

```html copy
<p>My cat is very grumpy</p>
```

## Anatomy of an HTML element

Let's explore this paragraph element a bit further.
![Anatomy of an HTML element](/html-anatomy.png)

The main parts of our element are as follows:

1. The opening tag: This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.

2. The closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.
3. The content: This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.
4. The element: The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the HTML element.

## Nesting elements

You can put elements inside other elements too — this is called nesting.

To understand what nesting is, Lets take an example of hwo wrap a gift. You find that you have a wrapping paper, then inside it you have a box and then inside it you have a diamond gift

![Fundamentals](/nesting.png)
HTML Nesting Explained with Gift Wrapping:

1. `Wrapping Paper (<WrappingPaper>):`

This is like the outermost HTML element. It's the first layer that contains everything else. In a webpage, this could be the `<body>` tag that wraps all visible content.

2. Box `(<Box>)`:
   Inside the wrapping paper, we have a box. This is nested within the wrapping paper, just like how in HTML, elements can be placed inside other elements. The box could represent a `<div>` or `<section>` in HTML that groups related content.

3. Diamond (`<Diamond>`):
   The diamond is the innermost element, nested inside both the box and the wrapping paper. In HTML, this could be a specific piece of content like an `<img>` tag or a `<p>` tag with text.

The nesting structure looks like this:

```html copy
<WrappingPaper>
  <Box>
    <Diamond> </Diamond>
  </Box>
</WrappingPaper>
```

This structure mirrors how you would physically wrap a gift:

- You start with the wrapping paper laid out.
- You place the box on the wrapping paper.
- Inside the box, you put the diamond gift.
- You then close the box.
  Finally, you wrap the paper around the box.

In HTML, this nesting allows for organization and structure of content. Each "layer" can have its own properties and styling, just like how the wrapping paper, box, and diamond each have their own characteristics in gift-giving.

## **Anatomy of an HTML document**

That wraps up the basics of individual HTML elements, but they aren't handy on their own. Now we'll look at how individual elements are combined to form an entire HTML page.

```HTML filename="index.html"

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>

```

### Layout Exaplanations

`<!DOCTYPE html>` : Is used to define the document type and version of HTML being used in a webpage and ensures that the web browser renders the page correctly according to the HTML5 specifications.

`<html></html>` : is the root element of an HTML document. It encompasses all the content of the webpage.

`<title></title>` : Specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab).

`<head></head>` : contains meta information about the HTML page. Meta information describes the page's content, character encoding, author, keywords, viewport settings, and other details. Metadata is not displayed on the page itself but is used by browsers, search engines, and other web services to understand and process the content of the page.

`<body></body>` : Acts as a container for all the visible contents, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.

### Starting up a project with HTML in Vs code

<Steps>
####  Download and Install VS Code
 
If you haven't already, download and install VS Code from the official website(link and procedures in the html and css tutorials introduction).

#### Set Up Your Project Folder

On your computer, create a new folder where you'll store your website files. Open the folder in Vs code.

#### Create your first HTML file

In VS Code, go to the "File" menu again and select "New File" (or press Ctrl+N).
Name your new file **index.html** ( this is a common naming convention for the main page of a website).

#### Add Basic HTML Structure

Open the **index.html** file.
Type **!** and press **Tab** or **Enter**. This is a shortcut provided by Emmet, a plugin included in VS Code that helps you write HTML and CSS faster. It will generate a basic HTML structure for you, and it should look like this;

```HTML5 copy filename="Html"
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge">
  <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>

</body>
</html>

```

</Steps>

## HTML Elements

HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML documents and consist of an opening tag, content, and a closing tag.

**Attributes**; are used to provide additional information about HTML elements. Attributes are always included in the opening tag of an element and consist of a name and a value. They modify the default behavior or appearance of the elements they are associated with.

### Examples include;

`<p></p>` : Used to write paragraphs in an HTML page.

```HTML5 copy
<p>This is a paragraph tag/element</p>
```

`<h1></h1>`-`<h6></h6>` : Represent six levels of section headings h1 being the biggest and h6 being the smallest.

```HTML5 copy
<h1>This is a the biggest heading...</h1>
<h6>This is a the smallest heading...</h6>
```

`<span></span>`: Used for styling and grouping inline elements without affecting the flow of content.

```HTML5 copy
<h1>This is a the <span>heading</span>...</h1>
```

`<a></a>`: Defines a hyperlink, which is used to link internal pages or to external web pages. It has an **attribute** called **href** in which the actual link is placed.

```HTML5 copy
<a href='www.who.com'>This is a the link...</a>
```

`<from></from>`: Represents a form that can be submitted to a server.

```HTML5 copy
<form action='/submit' method='post'>
<...form elements...>
</form>
```

`<label></label>`: used to represent a caption for an item in a user interface. It has an **attribute** called **for** that acts the name of the label tag

```HTML5 copy
<label for="username">Username</label>
```

`<button></button>`: used to create clickable buttons on a webpage. It has an **attribute** which is known as **type** which determines the behavior of the the button types include; submit, button, reset, disabled and many more

```HTML5 copy filename="Html"
<button type="submit">Submit</button>
  <button type="reset">Reset</button>
```

`<div></div>`: It's like a box that you can use to group other HTML elements like the paragraphs together.

```HTML5 copy filename="Html"
<div>
    <p>Content inside a div.</p>
</div>
```

#### Lists

These lists are essential for presenting content in a clear and organized manner.

#### Types of lists

There are two types of commonly used lists;

<Steps>
### Unordered lists
 
Used for lists where the order of items doesn't matter.
They are created using the `<ul>` and `<li>` tags.
Each list item is preceded by a bullet point.
```HTML5 copy
<ul>
  <li>Item 1</li>
  <li>Item 2</li>
  <li>Item 3</li>
</ul>
```

### Ordered lists

Used for lists where the order of items is important.
They are created using the `<ol>` and `<li>` tags.
Each list item is preceded by a number.

```HTML5 copy filename="Html"
<ol>
  <li>First item</li>
  <li>Second item</li>
  <li>Third item</li>
</ol>
```

</Steps>

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  There are some element that don't have a closing tag and are known as self
  closing elements
</Callout>

`<img/>`: Embeds an image in the document.. It has **attributes** called **src** in which the actual link of the image is placed and **alt** where short notes about the image are placed.

```HTML5 copy
<img src='www.who.com' alt='loading'/>
```

`<input/>`: Represents a typed data field, such as a text field, checkbox, radio button, submit button, etc. It has **attributes** called **type** which shows the type of the input eg text, checkbox etc, **name** shows the name of the input, **placeholder**: shows an example of what is to be written in the input

```HTML5 copy
<input type='text' name='name' placeholder='write your name here.'/>
```

`<br/>`: Inserts a line break.

```HTML5 copy
<p>First line<br>Second line</p>
```

`<hr/>`: Inserts a horizontal rule.

```HTML5 copy
<hr/>
```

##### The class attribute

A class attribute is an attribute that is used in targeting of a specific element in an HTML document.

```HTML5 copy filename="Html"
<div class="city">
  <h2>London</h2>
  <p>London is the capital of England.</p>
</div>
```

Where "city" is the class name which is used when applying styles to the `div` element

### Formatting Elements

They are used to style the text content within a web page.

**Examples include;**

`<b>`: Bold text.

`<i>`: Italic text.

`<u>`: Underlined text.

`<big>`: Larger text.

`<small>`: Smaller text.

`<sup>`: Superscript text.

`<sub>`: Subscript text.

`<strong>`: Important text (often rendered bold).
