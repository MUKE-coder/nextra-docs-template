## General Guidelines

- Use version control (Git) for all projects.
- Write clean, readable, and well-documented code.
- Follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.
- Implement proper error handling and logging.
- Regularly update dependencies and address security vulnerabilities.
- Use linters and formatters (e.g., ESLint, Prettier) to maintain code quality and consistency.

## Naming Conventions

- Use camelCase for variable and function names (e.g., `getUserData`, `isValid`).
- Use PascalCase for class and component names (e.g., `UserProfile`, `Button`).
- Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants (e.g., `MAX_RETRY_COUNT`, `API_BASE_URL`).
- Use kebab-case for file names (e.g., `user-profile.tsx`, `api-utils.ts`).
- Prefix interface names with "I" (e.g., `IUserData`).
- Use descriptive and meaningful names for all identifiers.

## Environment Variables

- Store sensitive information (API keys, database credentials) in environment variables.
- Use a `.env` file for local development and ensure it's included in `.gitignore`.
- Reference environment variables using `process.env.VARIABLE_NAME` in Node.js and Next.js.
- For React Native, use a package like `react-native-dotenv` to manage environment variables.
- Never hardcode sensitive values directly in the source code.

## Next.js Best Practices

- Use Static Generation (SSG) whenever possible for better performance.
- Implement dynamic imports and lazy loading for better code splitting.
- Utilize Next.js Image component for optimized image loading.
- Implement proper SEO practices using Next.js Head component.
- Use getServerSideProps for server-side rendering when necessary.
- Implement proper error handling and custom error pages.

## Node.js Best Practices

- Use async/await for asynchronous operations instead of callbacks.
- Implement proper error handling using try/catch blocks.
- Use middleware for common functionalities (e.g., authentication, logging).
- Implement input validation and sanitization to prevent security vulnerabilities.
- Use a process manager like PM2 for production deployments.
- Implement proper logging using a library like Winston or Pino.

## React Native (with Expo) Best Practices

- Use functional components and hooks instead of class components.
- Implement proper navigation using React Navigation.
- Use Expo SDK features and APIs when available.
- Optimize performance by minimizing re-renders and using memoization.
- Implement proper error boundaries to catch and handle errors gracefully.
- Use responsive design practices to ensure compatibility across different device sizes.

## TypeScript Best Practices

- Define proper types and interfaces for all data structures.
- Use type inference when possible to reduce verbosity.
- Utilize union types and intersection types for more precise type definitions.
- Use `unknown` instead of `any` when the type is truly unknown.
- Leverage TypeScript's strict mode for enhanced type checking.
- Use generics to create reusable components and functions.

## Code Review Process

- All code changes must go through a pull request process.
- At least one team member must review and approve the changes before merging.
- Use a consistent PR template to ensure all necessary information is provided.
- Reviewers should check for code quality, adherence to guidelines, and potential bugs.
- Address all comments and suggestions before merging the PR.
- Squash commits before merging to maintain a clean Git history.
