# Adding Multiple Layouts for Front and Dasboard Pages

When building projects with Next.js, we typically create an entire user interface by assembling isolated components. However, some parts of the interface require the same code snippets across multiple routes — for example, the navigation header, footer, and sidebar.

To manage this, we use layouts to structure the interface in a way that contains shared code snippets. In this lesson, we’ll delve into managing layouts and nested layouts in Next.js using the App Router.

Therefore the Layout helps to give a group of pages the same template which gives them a simillar look.

Forxample in this app, we have the Portifolio front Pages which will be public to all visitors and there is also the dashboard pages which have a different look from the front pages.

so we divide our pages into two groups: the front group => (front) and the admin group => (admin)

so this means we will have 3 layouts

- the main Layout (`layout.tsx `) sitted in the `app` directory directly (This layout controls the entire website)
- the admin Layout (`layout.tsx `) sitted in the `app/(admin)` directory (This layout controls the admin pages)
- the front Layout (`layout.tsx `) seated in the `app/(front)` directory (This layout controls the front pages of the site)

so for Each Group will have its own layout,

and here is the folder structure:

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="app" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.Folder name="(admin)">
      <FileTree.File name="layout.tsx" />
      <FileTree.Folder name="dashboard">
        <FileTree.File name="page.tsx" />
      </FileTree.Folder>
    </FileTree.Folder>
    <FileTree.Folder name="(front)">
      <FileTree.File name="layout.tsx" />
      <FileTree.File name="page.tsx" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
    <FileTree.File name="layout.tsx" />
    <FileTree.File name="globals.css" />
    <FileTree.File name="favicon.ico" />
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>
