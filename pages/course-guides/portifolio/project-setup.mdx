## Create a new Next JS Project

I recommend starting a new Next.js app using `create-next-app`, which sets up everything automatically for you. To create a project, run:

```js filename=">_ Terminal" copy
 npx create-next-app@latest
```

On installation, you'll see the following prompts:

```js filename=">_ Terminal" lineNumbers
  What is your project named? my-app
  Would you like to use TypeScript? No / Yes
  Would you like to use ESLint? No / Yes
  Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? No / Yes
  Would you like to use `src/` directory? No / Yes
  Would you like to use App Router? (recommended) No / Yes
```

## Host your Project

I recommend that we host our project immediately before addding alot of components, depencies and complex concepts. Follow the following steps

Midify Git Ignore:

- To your .gitignore file in you root of your project
- Inside this file, add .env file to avoid leaking your secret credentials

Initialize Git Repository:

```js filename=">_ Terminal" copy
 git init
```

Add Files to Staging Area:

```js filename=">_ Terminal" copy
 git add .
```

Commit Changes:

```js filename=">_ Terminal" copy
 git commit -m "initial commit"
```

Migrate to the main branch:

```js filename=">_ Terminal" copy
 git branch -M main
```

Create a New GitHub Repository:

--Go to GitHub and log in to your account. Then, create a new repository by clicking on the "+" icon in the top right corner and selecting "New repository". Follow the prompts to create your repository.

Add Remote Repository URL:
Once you've created the repository on GitHub, copy the repository URL provided.

Link Local Repository to GitHub Repository:
Back in your terminal or command prompt, use the following command to link your local repository to the GitHub repository. Replace repository_url with the URL you copied in the previous step.

```js filename=">_ Terminal" copy
 git remote add origin repository_url
```

Push Changes to GitHub:
Finally, push your local repository's commits to the GitHub repository using the following command:

```js filename=">_ Terminal" copy
 git push -u origin main
```

## Common Git errors

Fatal: Not a Git Repository (or any of the parent directories):

```js filename=">_ Terminal" copy
 git init
```

Author Identity Unknown, Please Tell Me Who You Are:

```js filename=">_ Terminal" copy
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"

```

Fatal: Remote Origin Already Exists:

```js filename=">_ Terminal" copy
git remote rm origin
git remote add origin <new_remote_url>

or Change the existing url
git remote set-url origin <new_remote_url>

```

Host your Project on Vercel

- Login tour vercel account, then add new Project from Github and then deploy
- High Chanches are, that it will deploy successfully
